# Customised Python Calculator 

## Fraser O' Regan Smith
### Fit for purpose 

#### Design breif:
Calculator is designed for primary school students
quite light & bright colours used, because primary school students don't want it blain and boring. I also used 4 colours for that exact reason.
I was planning on doing little cartoon pictures around the border of the calculator but my computer was broken and I didn't have it for 3 weeks
