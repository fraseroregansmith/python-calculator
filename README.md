# Customised Python Calculator 

## Fraser O' Regan Smith
### Fit for purpose 

#### Design breif:
Calculator is designed for primary school students
quite light & bright colours used, because primary school students don't want it blain and boring. i also used 4 colours for that exact reason
I also think the cartoons on the sides are A cool addidition
